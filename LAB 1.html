  <p> Frank Herbert wrote the original Dune series. The first book of that series, "Dune", is the best selling science fiction novel of all time and has served to influence and inspire science fiction since. This series stands out to
      me because of how it highlights a key aspect of cience fiction: science fiction uses ideas about the future to talk about the present. While almost incredibly vast in scale, both in time and ideas, the Dune series speaks to very 
      real problems of the modern day: long standing corruption, the pressure and harm that society can cause, disregard for cultures outside of what is considered "acceptable", working against the environment resulting in fully avoidable 
      consequences, and even how overreliance on AI results in easier opression by governments are all adressed in the series, and more. </p>
